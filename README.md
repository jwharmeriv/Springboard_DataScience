# Springboard
As a Data Scientist transitioning from a robust background in Supply Chain leadership, including a significant role as a Director of Warehousing & Logistics, I offer a unique fusion of operational excellence and analytical prowess. Currently sharpening my skills through a Data Science Career Track bootcamp at Springboard, I bring to the table an exceptional ability in transforming complex data into actionable business strategies. My experience in establishing a warehousing and logistics department from the ground up has fortified my capabilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. This blend of operational insight and data analytical skills positions me as a dynamic asset to teams aiming to harness data for strategic decision-making. I'm committed to leveraging my analytical and programming acumen to ask the right questions, solve pertinent problems, and clearly articulate findings, driving growth and efficiency across functions.
